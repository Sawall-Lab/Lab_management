## Protocol

### 1. Sample Preparation

1. **Determine lipid analysis requirement**  
   - If *not* analyzing total lipids → proceed with direct air picking  
   - If analyzing total lipids:
     1. Cut a ~1 × 1 cm fragment using a Dremel
     2. Ensure fragment fits in 20 mL glass vials
     3. Wrap in aluminum foil and store at **−80 °C**, or place directly into vial

### 2. Tube Labeling

$\square$ Coral ID  
$\square$ Time point/ Date  
$\square$ Parameter analyzed  

---

### 3. Coral Rinsing and Thawing

1. Rinse coral fragment with **filtered seawater (FSW)** to:
   - Remove debris and mucus
   - Begin defrosting

2. **Do NOT rinse fire corals (*Millepora alcicornis*)**, as tissue washes out easily.

---

### 4. Air Picking Procedure

1. Place coral fragment inside a Ziploc bag with a small amount of FSW  
2. Hold fragment from the outside of the bag  
3. Begin air picking from one corner:
   - Use a left–right (zig-zag) motion
   - Push tissue toward the bottom of the bag
4. Hold air pistol nozzle **1–2 mm** from tissue
   - Insert into polyps when possible (e.g., *Montastraea*)
5. Maintain moisture:
   - Humidify with FSW every **5–10 seconds**
   - Prevent tissue drying (dry tissue is very difficult to recover)

---

### 5. Slurry Collection and Volume Standardization

1. Cut one corner of the Ziploc bag  
2. Pour slurry into a **15 mL Falcon tube**  
3. Adjust volume with FSW if needed  
4. Record **total slurry volume** (critical for standardization)

> **Tip:** Standardize to **12 mL** total slurry volume for each coral.

---

### 6. Homogenization

1. Homogenize slurry using Ultra-Turrax for **~20 seconds**
   - Move probe up and down inside tube
2. Clean homogenizer probe:
   1. Run probe in first MilliQ beaker
   2. Rinse probe (including internal hole) with MilliQ
   3. Run probe in second beaker
   4. Dry probe exterior with Kimwipe
   5. Run homogenizer for **2 seconds** outside beakers to remove residual droplets

---

### 7. Subsampling for Downstream Analyses

Aliquot slurry as follows:

☐ 1 mL → Zooxanthellae count  
☐ 500 µL → Total proteins  
☐ 1 mL → Zooxanthellae identification  
☐ 1.5 mL → Proteomics  
☐ 500 µL → Chlorophyll *a*  
☐ 300 µL → HPLC pigment analysis (in 15 mL Falcon tube)

---

### 8. Final Steps

1. Photograph coral skeleton with ruler for surface area analysis  
2. Place all tubes immediately at **−80 °C**

## Notes and Best Practices

- Keep slurry **on ice at all times** when possible  
- For sensitive analyses (DNA, RNA, proteomics), perform air picking **on ice**
