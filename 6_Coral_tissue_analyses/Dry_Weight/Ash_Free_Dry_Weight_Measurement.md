**Author(s):** Xinya Calhoun  
**Lab:** Sawall Lab / MABEE Lab

## Overview

This protocol is used to calculate the ash free dry weight of pre-collected coral tissue slurrys.

<h2 id="Materials">Materials</h2>

- Aluminum pans
    - Any size will do but a small one (~2.4cm diameter) is large enough for 2mL samples.
- Coral tissue samples
- Gloves
- Drying oven (60°C)
    - Dry oven is owned by [Andrew Peters](apeter95@bios.asu.edu) - check with him that it is free to use!
- Muffle furnace (aka combustion oven) (450°C)
    - Dry oven is owned by [Andrew Peters](apeter95@bios.asu.edu) - check with him that it is free to use!
- Tray
- Desiccator
    - Desiccator is from [Amy Maas](amaas4@asu.edu) - check with her that it is free to borrow!
- Analytical balance (4-decimal place or more)
- 1 mL pipette and tips
- Vortex
- [Dry weight template table](../Dry_Weight/Ash_Free_Dry_Weight_Template.xlsx)

<h4 id="Purchasing_new_materials">Purchasing new materials</h4>

- Aluminum pans and pipette tips can be purchased online through various sites.
- Gloves can be purchased through the front desk at reception or through Lab Operations ([Yasah Pitcher](ypitcher@bios.asu.edu), [Jess Godfrey](Jessica_Godfrey@bios.asu.edu)).
    - If from reception must be charged to the Lab, ask Yvonne for the appropriate bank account code.

<h2 id="Procedure">Procedure</h2>

Use gloves while touching burned pans as the balance is very sensitive!

1. Label each aluminum pan with an ID, using a pen or a pencil and indenting into the aluminum.
    - The pencil or pen will get burned off, only the indent of the ID will remain so ENSURE the indent is there and readable.
    - Do NOT use a marker as it will get burned off. 
2. Record aluminum pan IDs (column A) and Coral IDs (column B) in the template table. 
3. Place the pans as well as a large sheet of aluminum foil in the muffle furnace and turn it on at 450°C for 4-6 hours.
    - The muffle furnace gets very hot so you will have to turn off the muffle furnace, open the door by a crack, and let it cool for an hour or two.
4. Once cool, and take the burned sheet of aluminum foil out of the oven and line tray with the foil.
5. Take the pans out of the muffle furnace and place on the tray.
    - From now on, burned pans should sit on the burned aluminum foil when out of the ovens, either on the tray or in the desiccator.
6. Weight the pans using the balance and record it on the table (column D).
    - The balance in room 206 is finicky and may take some time for the weight to stabilize.
7. Remove frozen tissue homogenate from freezer and thaw.
8. For each coral sample, vortex the tissue homogenate and pipette 2mL of the homogenate into the appropriate aluminum pan.
9. Transfer the filled aluminum pans to drying oven at ~60-80°C for at least 24 hours.
10. Dry the desiccant beads in the dry oven at ~60-80°C with the samples.
    - They only need to be dried for ~12-24 hours, but the need to be taken out of the oven at the same time as the samples.
    - Desiccant beads are a purple colour when they need to go in the oven and turn more of a blue colour when ready.
11. Transfer the pans to the desiccator and transport them to the balance.
12. **IMPORTANT**: the pans should eventually be at a constant weight. Leaving the samples in the oven for longer than 24hr may be necessary. To ensure constant weight, weigh a few of the pans after 24 hours in the dry oven, then put them back in the dry oven for 6 hours, then weight the same pans again - if the weight has not changed, then the samples are at constant weight.
    - The samples may have to go back in the oven a few times to achieve constant weight.
13. Once samples have achieved constant weight, remove the beads and place them in the base of the desiccator and remove the pans and place them in the dessicator.
14. Weight the pans using the balance and record it on the table (column E).
    - For each pan, remove from the dessicator to weight, and then put it back. Since the samples is out of the dessicator, the salt crystals can absorb moisture from the surrounding air and influence the weight, as the balance is sensitive. Though the weight of a pan may still be fluctuating, record the value after 20s.
15. Transfer the pans to the muffle furnace and turn it on at 450°C for 4-6 hours.
    - This final step will leave salt and inorganics behind in the pan.
    - The muffle furnace gets very hot so after the 4-6 hours you will have to turn off the muffle furnace, open the door by a crack, and let it cool for an hour or two.
16. Once cool, remove the pans and place them in the desiccator.
    - Pans MUST be cooled to room temperature, transporting when warm will cause water to adhere to the pans.
17. Weight the pans using the balance and record it on the table (column G).
