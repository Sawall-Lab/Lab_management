<h2 id="Materials_&_Reagents">Materials & Reagents</h2>

List all required materials with details that support reproducibility.

- Chemical name, grade, purity  
- Supplier & catalog number  
- Storage conditions  
- Shelf life  
- Working concentrations and how to prepare them  


<h4 id="Example">Example</h4>

- **99.5% Ethanol**, Molecular Grade (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #459844)  
- **Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit** (ThermoFisher, Cat. #23255)


<h2 id="Equipment">Equipment</h2>

Include all instruments, software, and hardware.

- Model, manufacturer, and serial number  
- Calibration notes  
- Required settings (e.g., temperature, speed, gain, cycle time)  
- Software version numbers    


<h2 id="Sample_Preparation">Sample Preparation</h2>

Describe any pre-processing steps:

- Sample preservation  
- Filtration or homogenization  
- Storage temperatures  
- Incubation time before measurement  
- Subsampling strategy

<h2 id="Procedure">Procedure</h2>

Provide steps **exactly as performed**, using numbered lists for clarity.

1. Step-by-step instructions.  
2. Include as much detail as possible. 
3. Add notes for optional steps or troubleshooting as necessary.  

**Important:**  
- Specify **units**, **temperatures**, **volumes**, **incubation times**, and **rates**.  
- Include stopping points where the procedure may be paused.


<h2 id="Quality_Control_&_Calibration">Quality Control & Calibration</h2>

Document all required QC checks:

- Calibration curves  
- Standard acceptance criteria (e.g., ±2%)  
- Blanks, technical replicates, and internal standards  
- Frequency of calibration (daily, per batch, per instrument start)  
- These are just a few examples.


<h2 id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

Provide actionable solutions to likely issues.

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| Low signal | Dirty cuvette | Clean thoroughly with kimwipe + RO water |
| High blank | Reagent contamination | Prepare fresh reagents |
| Drift | Temperature instability | Allow longer equilibration | 


<h2 id="Safety_Notes">Safety Notes</h2>

- Required PPE (gloves, eye protection, lab coat, etc.)  
- Chemical hazards (corrosive, toxic, carcinogenic, etc.)  
- Spill response  
- Waste disposal instructions (solid vs. liquid waste)  
- Biosafety considerations  


<h2 id="Data_Logging_&_Record-Keeping">Data Logging & Record-Keeping</h2>

Specify where the outputs go.

- **Raw data file format:** (e.g., `.csv`, `.txt`, `.xlsx`)  
- **Metadata requirements:** date, operator, temperature, instrument settings  
- **Naming convention:**  
  - `SampleID_AnalysisType_YYYYMMDD_operator.csv`
  

<h2 id="Versioning_Notes">Versioning Notes</h2>

- v1.0 — Initial protocol  
- v1.1 — Minor edits, formatting improvements  
- v2.0 — Major methodological update
