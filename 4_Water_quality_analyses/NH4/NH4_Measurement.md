<h2 id="Materials">Materials</h2>

-	Secondary standards (100µM), 2x 1.8mL
- BATS deep water (stored in fridge)
-	Pipets and tips (10mL, 5mL, 1000µL, 100µL, 10µL)
-	Repeater pipet and tips (50mL)
-	Working Reagent (WR)
-	15mL dark tubes (pre-aged)

Table 1: own standard range
| NH<sub>4</sub> | Volume of matrix (LNSW, MQ, etc.) (mL) | Volume of Secondary Standard (µL) |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| (BF) 0.00 | 10.000 | 0 |
| (0) 0.00 | 10.000 | 0 |
| 0.02 | 9.998 | 2 |
| 0.05 | 9.995 | 5 |
| 0.10 | 9.990 | 10 |
| 0.40 | 9.960 | 40 |
| 1.00 | 9.900 | 100 |
| 2.00 | 9.800 | 200 |
| 5.00 | 9.500 | 500 |

<h4 id="Preparation">Preparation</h4>

1. Bring all samples and reagents to room temperature.
2. Add BATS deep water to 15mL pre-aged tubes according to table 1.
3. Add secondary standard according to table 1.
4. Aliquot 10mL sample to 15mL pre-aged tubes.
5. Insert a 50mL tip in the repeater pipet and set to 2.5 setting.
6. Add 2.5mL WR to each tube, except the BF tube. Invert 5 times and store in the dark.
7. Incubate for 4-6 hours in the dark.


<h4 id="Measurement">Measurement</h4>

The Table Template for this analysis can be found [here](../NH4/NH4_template.xlsx).

1. Power up the Trilogy.
    - Ideally 10-30 minutes before starting measurements to let it warm up.
2. Insert the quartz cuvette.
    - Good to give a quick rinse with MQ depending on when last used.
3. Add 2.5mL WR to the BF samples, mix and measure immediately.
4. Measure the standard ranges.
5. Measure the samples, if the triplicates indicate first reading was contaminated by previous sample measure a 4th time.
6. Measure the standard ranges again.
7. Leave old sample and standards in tubes to age.
8. Discard liquid in vacuum flask to waste container.
