<h2 id="Materials">Materials/h2>

-	Secondary standards (100 \mu M), 2x 1.8mL
- BATS deep water (stored in fridge)
-	Pipets and tips (10mL, 5mL, 1000\mu L, 100\mu L, 10\mu L)
-	Repeater pipet and tips (50mL)
-	Working Reagent (WR)
-	15mL dark tubes (pre-aged)

Table 1: own standard range
| NH<sub>4</sub> | Volume of matrix (LNSW, MQ, etc.) (mL) | Volume of Secondary Standard (\mu L) |
|--------|----------------|--------|----------------|
| (BF) 0.00 | 10.000 | 0 |
| (0) 0.00 | 10.000 | 0 |
| 0.02 | 9.998 | 2 |
| 0.05 | 9.995 | 5 |
| 0.10 | 9.990 | 10 |
| 0.40 | 9.960 | 40 |
| 1.00 | 9.900 | 100 |
| 2.00 | 9.800 | 200 |
| 5.00 | 9.500 | 500 |

-	Bring all samples and reagents to room temperature.
-	Add BATS deep water to 15mL pre-aged tubes according to table 1.
-	Add secondary standard according to table 1.
-	Aliquot 10mL sample to 15mL pre-aged tubes.
-	Insert a 50mL tip in the repeater pipet and set to 2.5 setting.
-	Add 2.5mL WR to each tube, except the BF tube. Invert 5 times and store in the dark.
-	Incubate for 4-6 hours in the dark.

<h4 id="Measurement">Measurement/h4>

- Table Template can be found [here](../NH4/NH4_template.xslx).

-	Power up the Trilogy.
    - Ideally 10-30 minutes before starting measurements to let it warm up.
-	Insert the quartz cuvette.
    - Good to give a quick rinse with MQ depending on when last used.
-	Add 2.5mL WR to the BF samples, mix and measure immediately.
-	Measure the standard ranges.
-	Measure the samples, if the triplicates indicate first reading was contaminated by previous sample measure a 4th time.
-	Measure the standard ranges again.
-	Leave old sample and standards in tubes to age.
-	Discard liquid in vacuum flask to waste container.
